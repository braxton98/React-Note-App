# React-Note-App
<hx>**How I worked on This project**</hx> <br/>
My goal was to get a better understanding of the react fundamentals and work on using hooks and working on making it better on different screens, also got a better understanding of prop drilling<br/>


  * I started with a list of the different components that I would need  <br/>
  * I worked on the easiest components first, the ones that would not need any hooks <br/>
  * I watched tutorials on React to understand the basics then started using hooks to be able to change the state of the notes so that you can delete and add new notes as well as search through them <br/>

<hx>**Why I built this project**</hx> <br/>
* The purpose of this project was to work on my React skills and start making portfolio projects to show to other people <br/>
